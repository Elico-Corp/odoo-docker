# odoo-docker
Docker files to build dockers based on:
* standard Odoo code
* OCB code
* Specific Chinese setup (mostly to remove specific Google references blocked in China and replace them with Chinese mirror)

This work is original based on the docker from http://www.xcg-consulting.fr and available here: https://hub.docker.com/r/xcgd/odoo/
